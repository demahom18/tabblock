# tabblock
A chrome extension who prevents websites to open new tabs

This is a quick project I did on the fly to test chrome extension development

# How it works

When enabled, it impeach new tabs to be open until you disable it

# How to install

You can clone it by taping
```bash
git clone https://github.com/demahom18/tabblock.git
```

go to chrome://extensions then enable `developer mode` on the right corner \n
and click the button `load unpacked` and load the folder you just created
